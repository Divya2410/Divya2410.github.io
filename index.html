							Hi! I am Divya, a 3rd year graduate student at Texas A&M University. My research focuses on the diversity of Type Ia supernovae, investigating their progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms to enhance 
								their reliability as standard candles in cosmology. These thermonuclear explosions are fundamental to measuring extragalactic distances, and a deeper understanding of their intrinsic variations is critical 
								for refining constraints on the accelerated expansion of the universe. Additionally, I study optical polarization in galaxies to probe the signatures of interstellar dust, magnetic fields, and large-scale 
								galactic structures. By analyzing the polarization properties of light, my work aims to explain the physical processes governing the interstellar medium and the structural evolution of galaxies within 
								the cosmic framework.

								<b>Imaging Polarimetry of M83 Galaxy</b> <br>
								<p> Magnetic fields regulate the overall star formation in galaxies and play a crucial role in molecular cloud evolution. Yet, their
								detailed morphology remains largely unclear. The galactic magnetic fields consist of two main components: a regular component 
								and a turbulent component. The regular component of the magnetic field arises mainly from large-scale dynamo processes. Isotropic fields 
								in the turbulent component, are created by chaotic processes like supernova explosions, stellar winds, and gas turbulence resulting in random, 
								directionless fields. Anisotropic magnetic fields result from compression, shear, or ordered flows in the ISM, where processes like 
								differential rotation and gas cloud dynamics align random fields into more ordered structures. </p>
					
								<p> Figure 1 shows the V-band optical polarization map of the M83 galaxy, observed using the VLT/FORS1. The original resolution of the 
								polarization map is 0.7" which is rebinned to a resolution of 4.4". Figure 2 shows the 6 cm radio 
								polarization map 12", obtained by combining data from the VLA and Effelsberg telescopes. While radio 
								polarization is very well tracing the large-scale ordered magnetic fields (composed of regular and anisotropic magnetic fields), it is 
								unable to capture the small-scale isotropic turbulent fields often present in star-forming regions and galactic outflows. These regions
								are crucial for understanding the interplay between magnetic fields, star formation, and feedback processes. Optical polarization, 
								however, is able to trace a lot more turbulent features. This result is revolutionary and demonstrates the capability of 
								imaging polarimetry to study interstellar dust, magnetic fields, and galactic structures. </p>

							<b>UV-Optical Analysis of High-Velocity Type Ia Supernova</b> <br> 
							<p>A type Ia supernova (SN Ia) is the explosion of a carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) in a binary or multiple system.
							Owing to the well-established correlations between their maximum luminosity and light curve decline rate 
							and between their colors and peak luminosity, these objects are ideal for measuring distances across the 
							universe. This has led to the groundbreaking discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe and, in-turn dark energy. </p>

							<p> However, despite the widespread use of SNe Ia to map cosmic expansion, the intrinsic diversity in their progenitors 
							and explosion mechanisms remain poorly understood, leading to systematic biases. There have been several classifications within SNe Ia based 
							on their light curve evolution and spectral features. The 91T-like or 99aa-like objects show a slow-declining, hot, 
							luminous end in their light curves. They have prominent Fe III features with weak Si II features in their maximum-light spectra. 
							99aa-like SNe Ia also show strong Ca II absorption that is much weaker in 91T-like objects. The 91bg-like objects are fast-declining, 
							cool, and subluminous. They are mostly found in the older stellar populations (i.e., passive host galaxies) and are sometimes claimed to be 
							a separate population from more normal SNe Ia. Si II absorption features play a key role in the spectral classification of SNe Ia. 
							Based on the blueshifted velocity of Si II absorption lines at the B-band maximum, SNe Ia are classified as normal velocity (NV, v < 12000 km/s) 
							or high velocity (HV, v >= 12000 km/s). Another classification of SNe Ia is proposed based on the absorption equivalent widths of 
							Si II λ 5972 and λ 6355 at maximum light: core normal (CN), broad line (BL), cool (CL), and shallow silicon (SS). An intriguing aspect 
							of these features is the presence of high-velocity components, commonly observed in early-time spectra. Ca II near-infrared (NIR) triplet 
							(λλλ 8498, 8542, 8662 Å) and Ca II H&K (λλ 3934, 3968 Å), also exhibit high-velocity components. The exact origin of these high velocity 
							features (HVFs) remains uncertain. </p>

							<p> Through my current research, I am studying the HST UV spectroscopy of 2022hrs, a HV SN Ia. HV SNe Ia tend to show intrinsically redder 
							colors compared to the normal SN Ia. Understanding the spectral and color evolution of a HV SN Ia is essential in understanding whether these
							SNe have a different progenitor system or explosion mechanism compared to the normal SNe Ia. Our preliminary analysis has shown that HV SNe Ia
							show different color evolution pre and post maxima compared to a normal SN Ia. They also tend to be affected by higher line-blanketing and show
							some absorption features which are not particularly prominent in other SNe Ia. Refer to the poster for more details.

							<b>Spectropolarimetry of Supernovae </b><br> Spectropolarimetry is a powerful diagnostic tool to study the geometry of the explosion by 
							studying the geometry of the supernova explosion by quantifying the asphericity of the explosion through polarization. The levels of polarization
							and asphericity helps us distinguish between the different explosion mechanisms at play and hints at the progenitor system of the supernovae 
							explosion.
