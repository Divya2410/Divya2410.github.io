							Hi! I am Divya Mishra, a 2nd year graduate student at Texas A&M University. I am studying optical polarization in a nearby spiral galaxy, the M83. I am also working on the spectroscopic analysis of SN 2022hrs. In my free time, I enjoy painting, exploring different genres of music, and watching movies and series. Singing and reading are therapeutic for me. I also love experimenting with new recipes.

								<b>Imaging Polarimetry of M83 Galaxy</b>

								
								
								My current research focuses on mapping magnetic fields in external galaxies using optical imaging polarimetry. There are two main mechanisms that cause optical polarization in galaxies: 
								scattering and dichroic extinction. Dust scattering in galaxies while observing pole-on produces polarization vectors that appear to be oriented tangentially around the galaxy's center, 
								forming a centrosymmetric pattern. In contrast, when observing a galaxy at higher inclinations (edge-on), the dust scattering occurs predominantly 
								in the direction perpendicular to the galaxy's disk. As a result, the scattered light tends to be polarized parallel to the galaxy's disk. 
								In dichroic extinction, the light gets preferentially absorbed or attenuated by the dust grains that align themselves along the magnetic field of the galaxy as the result of Davis-Greenstein effect. 
								The dust grains align such that their long axis is perpendicular to the field. As light traverses these aligned grains, 
								the electric field component parallel to the elongated axis gets absorbed yielding a net polarization parallel to the magnetic field. Our polarization maps
								suggest that optical polarization is mostly dominated by dichroic extinction. The data is obtained by ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT). Because of the high resolution of VLT, we
								can get detailed structure of polarization within the galaxy which is rather difficult to obtain by radio telescopes due to their limited resolution.

							<b>Spectropolarimetry of Type Ia Supernova</b><br> Another aspect of my research is to understand the explosion mechanism and progenitors of 
							Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia). SNe Ia has crucial applications in tracing the expansion history of the universe. However, the diversity of their 
							progenitors and explosion mechanisms are not well understood, leading to systematic biases. We aim to use spectropolarimetry, which is a technique that 
							exploits the polarization properties of light emitted by supernovae across various wavelengths and enables us to discern the overall shape of the emitting region.
							This overall geometry helps us differentiate between different models of SNe Ia, giving better constraints on the progenitors system and explosion mechanism.

								<b>Outreach: </b> As an astronomer, my passion lies in exploring the mysteries of the cosmos and sharing the wonders of the universe with others. 
									Through engaging outreach initiatives, I aim to spark curiosity and inspire awe about the beauty and complexity of the cosmos. 
									From captivating presentations and stargazing events to interactive workshops and educational resources, I strive to make astronomy accessible 
									to people of all ages and backgrounds.

								<b>Equity & Inclusion: </b> As the Treasurer of the Graduate Student Assembly for Physics and Astronomy and an officer in the Society for Underrepresented in Physics and Astronomy, 
								I am dedicated to advocating for the needs of graduate students and fostering a supportive environment within our academic community. 
								These organizations serve as vital platforms for addressing the challenges faced by graduate students, including mental health concerns, and provide a space for open 
								discussion and support. Through our work, we aim to promote inclusivity and address diversity gaps in the fields of physics and astronomy, 
								ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. Together, we strive to create a more equitable and supportive environment for all members of our academic community.
